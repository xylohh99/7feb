Happy Birthday, my love. 💖 It’s finally your day, and I wanted to start it by telling you how much you truly mean to me. These six months with you have been some of the most meaningful moments of my life you’ve brought so much happiness, comfort, and light into my days without even trying. You’ve motivated me to become a better person, to think differently, and to grow in ways I probably wouldn’t have on my own, and I’ll always be grateful to you for that. We bicker sometimes, we get annoyed at each other, and we don’t always agree but even in those moments, I’ve learned how much understanding, patience, and care there is between us. And even if I don’t always show it properly or say it enough, please know that my love for you is constant and genuine. I admire the way you smile, the way you care so deeply, and the warmth you bring into every space you’re in. On your birthday, I hope you realize how loved, cherished, and important you are not just to me, but to everyone lucky enough to know you and that you feel valued and excited for everything ahead of you, because you truly deserve all of that. Thank you for being you and for choosing to share your time and your heart with me. You mean so much to me, today and every day. 🌙✨
